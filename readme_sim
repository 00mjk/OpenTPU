__Functional Simulator__

sim.py implements the functional simulator of OpenTPU. It reads in three cmd args: the assembly program, the dram file and the host memory file. Due to the different quantization mechnisms between high-level applications (written in tensorflow) and OpenTPU, the simulator runs in two modes: 32b float mode and 8b int mode. The downsampling/quantization mechanism is consistent with the HW implementation of OpenTPU. It generates two sets of outputs, one set being 32b-float typed, the other 8b-int typed.

Example usage:

    python sim.py boston.a boston_input.npy boston_weights.npy

For the .npy data files, please refer to __Applications__ for how to generate them.

checker.py implementes a simple checking function to verify the results from HW, simulator and applications. It checkes the 32b-float application results against 32b-float simulator results and then checks the 8b-int simulator results against 8b-int HW results.

Example usage:

    python checker.py
